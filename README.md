## 🚀 Flutter Mobile Developer | Production Experience

Based in Nairobi, Kenya 🇰🇪  
Open to Remote • Hybrid • On-site  

I build production-ready mobile applications with a strong focus on scalability, structure, and long-term maintainability.

With 3+ years of Flutter experience and hands-on ownership in live environments, I approach development with architectural thinking — balancing delivery speed with system clarity.

> I believe well-structured code compounds in value over time.
